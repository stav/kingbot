# K1NGBOT

This is a Deno command line application that monitors trade events on XTB's
XStation 5 appliance via websocket connections.

## 1.0

The **kingbot** [Proof-of-concept][1] started early October 2021 and within a
month it was moving the _Break-even_ on the exchange by:

1. grouping multi-order positions into "families",
2. listening for _Take-profit_ events,
3. moving the _Stop-loss_ for all orders in the family to slightly better than
the entry.

We began trading with real money in December, the worst month.

## 2.0

Kingbot 2.0 is a rewrite of the code switching the execution engine from
[Node.js][2] to ðŸ¦•[Deno][3]. It started in December 2021. The plan is to have it
in production come the spring with the following features:

* monitor [Telegram][4] for _signals_,
* create orders on the exchange,
* move the Break-even.

With these features the bot can theoretically run fully-automatically.

## Family

An asset position may be comprised of multiple orders. _A family is a group of
orders all with the **exact same stop loss**._ Each order in the position would
have its own _take-profit_ price.

The sole purpose of the bot is to monitor the position and when a take-profit
price is reached then the stop loss is moved for all orders in the family to
a better level.

## No Meta Data

There is NO storage that keeps track of meta-data about orders.  When a trade
event happens (close, for example, due to take-profit) we only know about that
specific trade which may be part of a multi-order position.

Take the following received trade event that XTB sends:

    symbol: 'BITCOIN'
    open_price: 67458.03
    close_price: 66861.86
    position: 316522733
    comment: '[T/P]'
    profit: 59.62
    sl: 67206.15
    tp: 66863.15
    volume: 0.1

That's all the bot knows.  It doesn't know about the other orders (in the "family")
and their TP levels.  Instead the bot reasons about what to do solely from the
single trade event information that the server sends.

## Stop Loss

Once the bot is listening for trades it will spot orders closed because of _take
profit_ which will signal him to adjust the stop loss for all remaining orders in
the "family".

### Break-even Stop Loss

When the first TP level is reached the stop loss moves to 0.03% better than the
open price.

### Trailing Stop Loss

When TP2 is reached the bot moves to halfway between the open-price and the
close-price for this order.

For example: Say we have three orders in a "family" all with a stop loss of
`70239.44`:

    SL 70239.44 SELL BITCOIN TPs=[ 67133.03, 66998.09, 66863.15 ]

First we hit TP1:

    symbol     : 'BITCOIN'
    open_price : 67458.03
    close_price: 67122.13
    position   : 316522734
    comment    : '[T/P]'
    profit     : 33.59
    volume     : 0.1
    sl         : 70239.44
    tp         : 67133.03

The bot moves stop loss from `70239.44` to `67437.79 = 67458.03 - 20.24` for two
(2) orders.

Then we hit TP2:

    symbol     : 'BITCOIN'
    open_price : 67458.03
    close_price: 66994.74
    position   : 316522735
    comment    : '[T/P]'
    profit     : 46.33
    volume     : 0.1
    sl         :67437.79
    tp         :66998.09

The bot moves stop loss from
`67437.79` to `67206.15 = (67458.03 + 66994.74 / 2) - 20.24` for one (1) order.

Then TP3 (the last order) does not move any stop loss since there are none left
in the family, perhaps sadly; but, don't get emotional.

## Telegram

The job of the component is to:

1. listen to messages on certain Telegram chats,
2. parse the messages for signal data (e.g. entry price),
3. create an exchange position.

### Listen to messages on certain Telegram chats

Telethon is a Python library which was chosen because it allows for logging into
Telegram as a user (i.e. not a bot) and listening to any chat that the user is a
member of.

Since Telethon is not a JavaScript library it is started as a separate process.

### Parse the messages for signal data

### Create an exchange position

## Documentation

- XTB          <https://xstation5.xtb.com/>
- xAPI         <http://developers.xstore.pro/documentation/>
- Deno         <https://deno.land/>
- Rhum         <https://drash.land/rhum/>
- Velociraptor <https://velociraptor.run/docs/>

## Installation

The Kingbot uses these components:

* Git - version control (Not needed in future)
* Deno - execution engine runtime
* Velociraptor - script runner

### Install Deno

Deno works on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Deno is a single binary executable. It
has no external dependencies.

On Linux use cURL to download the installation script and run it in a shell:

    curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh

For other platforms see the [installation page][6].

### Script Runner

Velociraptor makes it easy to run scripts.

Install [Velociraptor][5]:

    deno install -qAn vr https://deno.land/x/velociraptor@1.4.0/cli.ts

Add Bash completion:

    source <(vr completions bash)

### Install the Kingbot

Deno doesn't use any package management files in the project. Modules are cached
when they are first encountered in the code; therefore, the bot doesn't need to
be installed. Just clone the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:stav/kingbot.git
    cd kingbot

### Configuration

Edit the file `.config/local.example.yaml` with your real information and save
it as `.config/local.yaml`.

## Usage

The Telegram client and server are currently decoupled. The _server_ is able to
be started from the main **deno** application but the _client_ must be started
manually.

### Start the Application

Open a new command-line terminal.

Make sure you are in the `kingbot` directory.

Start the **deno** runtime with [Velociraptor][5].

    vr start

#### Prime the Connections

    0[]> prime

#### Start the Telegram Server

The Telegram server listens to HTTP traffic on `localhost` port 8000.

Enter the `connect` command to start the server:

    0[-]> connect
    input "connect" (function) [Function: bound connect]
    Listening to localhost:8000 for { id:123456, name:"Demo", type:"demo" }

### Start the Telegram Client

Open a second command-line terminal.

Make sure you are in the `kingbot` directory.

Start the **Python** script to listen to configured **Telegram** chats.

    python ./src/bot/telegram/telethonx.py
