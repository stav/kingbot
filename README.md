# K1NGBOT

This is a Deno command line application that

- listens for trade signals from Telegram,
- opens positions on an exchange,
- listens for price events and
- moves the stop-loss for the entire position.

Currently the only exchange supported is XTB's XStation 5 appliance via websocket connections.

## 1.0

The **kingbot** [Proof-of-concept][1] started early October 2021 and within a
month it was moving the _Break-even_ on the exchange by:

1. grouping multi-order positions into "families",
2. listening for _Take-profit_ events,
3. moving the _Stop-loss_ for all orders in the family to slightly better than
the entry.

We began trading with real money in December, the worst month.

## 2.0

Kingbot 2.0 is a rewrite of the code switching the execution engine from
[Node.js][2] to ðŸ¦•[Deno][3]. It started in December 2021. The plan is to have it
in production come the spring with the following features:

* monitor [Telegram][4] for _signals_,
* create orders on the exchange,
* move the Break-even.

With these features the bot can theoretically run fully-automatically.

## Components

1. Bot written in TypeScript
2. Telegram client written in Python
3. Log file tools written in Rust

## Installation

The Kingbot uses these components:

* Git - version control (Not needed in future)
* Deno - execution engine runtime
* Velociraptor - script runner

### Install Deno

Deno works on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Deno is a single binary executable. It
has no external dependencies.

On Linux use cURL to download the installation script and run it in a shell:

    curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh

For other platforms see the [installation page][6].

### Script Runner

Velociraptor makes it easy to run scripts.

Install [Velociraptor][5]:

    deno install -qAn vr https://deno.land/x/velociraptor@1.4.0/cli.ts

Add Bash completion:

    source <(vr completions bash)

### Install the Kingbot

Deno doesn't use any package management files in the project. Modules are cached
when they are first encountered in the code; therefore, the bot doesn't need to
be installed. Just clone the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:stav/kingbot.git
    cd kingbot

### Configuration

Edit the file `.config/exchange.example.yaml` with your real information and save
it as `.config/exchange.yaml`.

Edit the file `.config/telegram.example.yaml` with your real information and save
it as `.config/telegram.yaml`.

## Usage

The Telegram client and server are currently decoupled. The _server_ is able to
be started from the main **deno** application but the _client_ must be started
manually.

### Start the Application

Open a new command-line terminal.

Make sure you are in the `kingbot` directory.

Start the **deno** runtime with [Velociraptor][5].

    vr start

You will spawn an interactive Kingbot interpreter:

    0[-]>

#### The prompt shows:

The exchange account index number currently active:

    0

Zero (0) index is the Telegram connection.

The prompt also shows the login status of current connection
surrounded by square brackets.

Dash (Telegram not connected):

    [-]

Finally, the greater-than input pointer character

    >

#### Start the Telegram Server

The Telegram server listens to HTTP traffic on `localhost` port 8000.

Enter the `connect` command to start the server:

    0[-]> connect
    input "connect" (function) [Function: bound connect]
    Listening to localhost:8000 for { id:123456, name:"Demo", type:"demo" }

    0[C]>

Send EOF (Ctrl-D End-of-file) to exit.

### Start the Telegram Client

Open a second command-line terminal.

Make sure you are in the `kingbot` directory.

Start the **Python** script to listen to configured **Telegram** chats.
