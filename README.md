# K1NGBOT

This is a Deno command line application that monitors trade events on XTB's
XStation 5 appliance via websocket connections.

## 1.0

The **kingbot** [Proof-of-concept][1] started early October 2021 and within a
month it was moving the _Break-even_ on the exchange by:

1. grouping multi-order positions into "families",
2. listening for _Take-profit_ events,
3. moving the _Stop-loss_ for all orders in the family to slightly better than
the entry.

We began trading with real money in December, the worst month.

## 2.0

Kingbot 2.0 is a rewrite of the code switching the execution engine from
[Node.js][2] to ðŸ¦•[Deno][3]. It started in December 2021. The plan is to have it
in production come the spring with the following features:

* monitor [Telegram][4] for _signals_,
* create orders on the exchange,
* move the Break-even.

With these features the bot can theoretically run fully-automatically.

## Family

An asset position may be comprised of multiple orders. _A family is a group of
orders all with the **exact same stop loss**._ Each order in the position would
have its own _take-profit_ price.

The sole purpose of the bot is to monitor the position and when a take-profit
price is reached then the stop loss is moved for all orders in the family to
a better level.

## No Meta Data

There is NO storage that keeps track of meta-data about orders.  When a trade
event happens (close, for example, due to take-profit) we only know about that
specific trade which may be part of a multi-order position.

Take the following received trade event that XTB sends:

    symbol: 'BITCOIN'
    open_price: 67458.03
    close_price: 66861.86
    position: 316522733
    comment: '[T/P]'
    profit: 59.62
    sl: 67206.15
    tp: 66863.15
    volume: 0.1

That's all the bot knows.  It doesn't know about the other orders (in the "family")
and their TP levels.  Instead the bot reasons about what to do solely from the
single trade event information that the server sends.

## Stop Loss

Once the bot is listening for trades it will spot orders closed because of _take
profit_ which will signal him to adjust the stop loss for all remaining orders in
the "family".

### Break-even Stop Loss

When the first TP level is reached the stop loss moves to 0.03% better than the
open price.

### Trailing Stop Loss

When TP2 is reached the bot moves to halfway between the open-price and the
close-price for this order.

For example: Say we have three orders in a "family" all with a stop loss of
`70239.44`:

    SL 70239.44 SELL BITCOIN TPs=[ 67133.03, 66998.09, 66863.15 ]

First we hit TP1:

    symbol     : 'BITCOIN'
    open_price : 67458.03
    close_price: 67122.13
    position   : 316522734
    comment    : '[T/P]'
    profit     : 33.59
    volume     : 0.1
    sl         : 70239.44
    tp         : 67133.03

The bot moves stop loss from `70239.44` to `67437.79 = 67458.03 - 20.24` for two
(2) orders.

Then we hit TP2:

    symbol     : 'BITCOIN'
    open_price : 67458.03
    close_price: 66994.74
    position   : 316522735
    comment    : '[T/P]'
    profit     : 46.33
    volume     : 0.1
    sl         :67437.79
    tp         :66998.09

The bot moves stop loss from
`67437.79` to `67206.15 = (67458.03 + 66994.74 / 2) - 20.24` for one (1) order.

Then TP3 (the last order) does not move any stop loss since there are none left
in the family, perhaps sadly; but, don't get emotional.

- Deno <https://deno.land/>

## Installation

Deno doesn't use package management, per se. Modules are cached when they are
first encountered in the code.

    git clone git@github.com:stav/kingbot.git
    cd kingbot

### Configuration

Edit the file `.config/local.example.yaml` with your real information and save
it as `.config/local.yaml`.

## Usage

The Telegram client and server are currently decoupled. The _server_ is able to
be started from the main **deno** application but the _client_ must started
manually.

### Start the Application

Open a new command-line terminal.

Make sure you are in the `kingbot` directory.

Start the **deno** runtime with our application granting read/write/net permissions.

    deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-net ./src/app.ts

#### Start the Server

Enter the `connect` command to start the server:

    0[-]> connect
    input "connect" (function) [Function: bound connect]
    Serving
    Server { connected: true }

### Start the Client

Open a second command-line terminal.

Make sure you are in the `kingbot` directory.

Start the **Python** script to listen to **Telegram**.

    python ./src/bot/telegram/telethonx.py

    Connecting to 149.154.175.52:443/TcpFull...
    Connection to 149.154.175.52:443/TcpFull complete!
